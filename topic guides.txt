Creating a web form 


The basic steps involved in creating a form and allowing users to enter data via the form is as follows.

    If you haven’t already got one, create a forms.py file within your Django application’s directory to store form-related classes.
    Create a ModelForm class for each model that you wish to represent as a form.
    Customise the forms as you desire.
    Create or update a view to handle the form - including displaying the form, saving the form data, and flagging up errors which may occur when the user enters incorrect data (or no data at all) in the form.
    Create or update a template to display the form.
    Add a urlpattern to map to the new view (if you created a new one).
